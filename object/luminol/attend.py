explanation : when callback structure is designed for a model
.. via fundamental criteria, indata, outdata, frames, status, time .. has to be possible
.. for possible signature, the buffers resulting from (indata/outdata) must be processed via side-chaining
.. side-chain transforms the (left-right) channel into a singular valued decomposer node called `mid`
.. **mid** : it is a nucleus that along with the (side, ~side) pairing constructs a membrane of multidimensional form
.. .. multidimensional membrane is called `multitrack` which defines a **stack** at runtime for processing the buffered in values
.. .. mid-side matrix is a parametrized form whose sum and difference with the input vectors produce **left and right** channels
  .. **left and right** : a pair of channels each with their seperate identities connected via the *mid* component whose composition uses side-chained quantities in order to constuct a dynamical **state-space** (see: reversible information media) called **stereo-image**
  .. **stereo-image** : a two dimensional object defining a bijective map from the set **spherical** to **cartesian** (see: state-space)
.. .. .. **stack** : it is a set of **observable** quantities of dimension two or more that gets processed via a **reversible computation media**
.. .. .. .. **rerversible computation media** : it is a substrate with a set of at least two states such that for all observable in the states a permutation of that observable maps that variable to another variable whose and the union of all those variable yield another observable that implicitly define the information variable.
 .. while preparing the outdata buffer, there are disjoint substrates that compute the observables to be made available through populating the buffer-in frames:
 .. .. for all frames equaling indata ~ outdata via `frame (int) ~ time (CData)` programming, model maps the left-right reconstruction of the indata buffer to the mid-side matrix that is responsible for filling-in the outdata buffer (see: reversible computation media)
 .. .. each frame is subjected to the **bijection** constituted in defining the stereo-image potential (see: spherical, cartesian)
 .. .. **bijection** : a map that defines the integer-interger functional over all mid-side association to compute the **error rate**(s)
 .. .. **error rate** : a quantity which is a direct injection of the accumulated losses over the observable sets in permutating their variable while the elected set contributes to the mid-side processing
