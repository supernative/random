addressible : [parallel]

(PART 1/4)

interference : if I use the two states `ș | ś` of the measures `m[š, š]` in range of (a, .., z)
.. the two states each have an associated (x[ș], y[š]) and (x[š], y[ş]) pairs of disjoint attributes
. suppose š splits in half over the continuum of each of the state vectors in their respective associations with (mid +/- side) for all (a, .., b) that happens involving those attributes
 . (Deutsch) if we take the union of the two states for a permutation performed over each of them at least once, then it cannot carry any information.
 .. the union over the individual states of the individual substrates constitute merging of the universes at that point in history and all the branches have been offloaded.
. . the two channels are now operationally disjoint and local to our environment.
