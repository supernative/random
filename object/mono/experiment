addressible : [parallel, side chaining, branching, interference, union, merging]

(PART 1/4)

interference : if I use the two states `ș | ś` of the measures `m[š, š]` in range of (a, .., z)
.. the two states each have an associated (x[ș], y[š]) and (x[š], y[ş]) pairs of disjoint attributes
. suppose š splits in half over the continuum of each of the state vectors in their respective associations with (mid +/- side) for all (a, .., b) that happens involving those attributes
 . (Deutsch) if we take the union of the two states for a permutation performed over each of them at least once, then it cannot carry any information.
 .. the union over the individual states of the individual substrates constitute merging of the universes at that point in history and all the branches have been offloaded.
. . the two channels are now operationally disjoint and local to our environment.
 . here lies the program that unites the combined effect of the two locally disjoint substrates!


(PART 2/4)

two groups of instances of the two channels:
.. constitute a reversible information processing media
. we use those the two input/output ports seperately by including their memory into the construction media
 . the computation runs for a finite interval with each point in the measure constituting a uniquely addressable moment
. just keep in mind that there exists other observers in the room


(PART 3/4)

measures : a bar of measure is associated with every construction process
.. computation comes into the play at that point, perhaps even at other intermediate ones too
. however there are those moments in a bar that we incorporate information that would be relevant to us (computation)


(PART 4/4)

construct : a bar will be associated with every construction media
.. it is a set of attributes whose states are two fold
. one unit of differentiation is assumed for each bar where we associate another bar whose cause preceeded by the state delta
