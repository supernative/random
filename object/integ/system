(PART 1/4)

node : description
edge : constructor

We define consruction task as a link that connects two nodes via edge that connects them.
Construction is a process of taking the node given as input, and deliver it the target state associated with that initial attribute.

example_composition : {
    link : {
        node : <abstract>,
        edge : <physical>,
        antinode : <abstract>,
        connector : <serial/parallel>,
    },
}

link : construction task,
node : input state of the substrate,
edge : state attribute of the medium,
antinode : output state of the substrate,
connector : whether to compose serial or parallel transformation



(PART 2/4)

parallel composition : left (tensor product) right -> mid (exclusive-or) side : composite task
.. composite task (mid <- output of left) and (side <- output of right)
. where only their net effects are combined together.




(PART 3/4)

serial composition : (right-left) is the task of performing (left,) and then (,right) on the same substrate
.. if Output(left) = Input(right)
. (right-left) is serial construction.




(PART 4/4)

regular network : these network of tasks are a network without loops
.. whose nodes are tasks
. & whose lines are their substrates where
 . the legitimate input states at the end of each line
. . are the legitimate output states at its beginning!
 . loops are excluded because
. substrate on a loop is a constructor!
