// no arithmatic logic unit exists

// Header file: Spherical coordinate management of existing program space using their executables to derive the instantaneous position along the memory buffer.
// Source file: Cartesian coordinate management of existing function space using their parameters to derive the instantaneous momentum along the program queue.

// Program queue has variable length and height of the stack at any state update description.
// Instantaneous rate of attending the pointers that are participating in the computing process.


// cartesian state is a positional view of the memory
// a positional view have a [x, y, z, *] parameter view with * being shared with momentum view matrix
// this program can change the parameters between two different states along the runtime path if and only if the spherical programming sharing the * csn permute at least one of the states


This is system one:

(0, 0) execute `./position`, (0, 1) `position.c` —> (x, y, z, *)
(1, 0) compile `position.c`, (1, 1) execute `./momentum`

This is system two:
(1, 1) execute `./momentum`, (1, 2) `momentum.c` —> (r, phi, theta, *)
(2, 1) compile `momentum.c`, (2, 2) execute `./position`

Before writing the third system, first tell me what you understood these two systems to be doing.


`ameoba.py`

>>> environment = prepare_system(..)
>>> environment.from_position("./position")
>>> environment.from_momentum("./momentum")

Environment is prepared with ground level energy:
- specific organism will have part in the system with their position-momentum dual
- organism is evolved through environment processes for fixed period of time
- other constructions are compiled locally with their respective namedpaces
- local computations are executed globally from their associated attributes

samples = rec(frames=unit_size, channel=num_units)
position, momentum = samples.T

for unit in units:
    start = unit.forward(position) + unit    # starting position is the reaction with respect to the positional change in presence of the unit identity it-self
    stop = unit.backward(momentum) * start


`__instance__.forward(cartesian_coordinate)` :
.. what does it mean?
. it means to go forward through the internal gates with the data given as properties.

.. this reaches from the lowest point in time to highest point in time
. total period covers the pass through events given the knowledge provided

.. what does the additive term do?
. it is assumed that the total displacement of resource inside the instance substrate is reflected at the instance state

`__instance__.backward(spherical_coordinate)` :
.. what does it do?
. it asserts the physical correlates that evolves as function of the starting condition

.. multiplicative effect of the starting condition?
. start is the relative state vector formulation of the instance identity

// systems that run forever self-heal and scale
what things are possible in that machinary:
.. do you mean the general purpose computing machinary:
. no, universal!
