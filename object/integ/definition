computation:
.. defined on the states of a substrate of at least two states
. permutation over the states while uniting each computed elements together

. reversible information processing:
.. for state in states of the substrate:
 . union of {state —> pi(state)}
 .. defines information implicitly
. `pi` is an operator in that space.

if S and G are two compatible substrate with compability satisfying the implicit construction criteria:
.. each of them could be composed together via their information variable (s, g)
. a composite system {S (exclusive-or) G} is a system with observable {(s, g) | (s in S and g in G)}
 . it is possible to build a system of cartesian products with the two and any other variable
. the cartesian chain of possible product state combination could use the system to process information.

information : requires a clonable media on which information is the act of retaining a copy while relaying the original
.. start with an existing information media (`S`) and create two instances of it (`Ş, Ș`).
. cloning task is defined on `Ș` with one input variable `ș` which would be used to store the copy
 . it is a task Ċ[Ș](ş) : {(ș, ş) —> (ș, ș)} for all ș in Ș
 .. {Ş (exclusive-or) Ș} produces an information medium with `ş` not related to `ș` in any way
. Ċ may produce side-effects but it will be possible to prepare Ş with generic naturally occuring resources.
