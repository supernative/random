addresible : [computation, information, cloning, measurement, non-perturbative communication, reliable measurement]

(PART 1/4)

computation:
.. defined on the states of a substrate of at least two states
. permutation over the states while uniting each computed elements together

. reversible information processing:
.. for state in states of the substrate:
 . union over {state —> pi(state)}
 .. defines information implicitly
. `pi` is an operator in that space.

if S and G are two compatible substrate with compability satisfying the implicit construction criteria:
.. each of them could be composed together via their information variable (s, g)
. a composite system {S (exclusive-or) G} is a system with observable {(s, g) | (s in S and g in G)}
 . it is possible to build a system of cartesian products with the two and any other variable
. the cartesian chain of possible product state combination could use the system to process information.



(PART 2/4)

information : requires a clonable media on which information is the act of retaining a copy while relaying the original
.. start with an existing information media (`S`) and create two instances of it (`Ş, Ș`).
. cloning task is defined on `Ș` with one input variable `ș` which would be used to store the copy
 . it is a task Ċ[Ș](ş) : union over {(ș, ş) —> (ș, ș)} for all ș in Ș
 .. {Ş (exclusive-or) Ș} produces an information medium with `ş` not related to `ș` in any way
. Ċ may produce side-effects but it will be possible to prepare Ş with generic naturally occuring resources.



(PART 3/4)
   
measurement : in measuring some quantity in a remote system that would allow information state to be persistent
.. measurer sends an information variable to the medium of the other that satisfies the permutation of their joint state
. the other has one of its computation variable at that state while the permutation used the information variable of the measurer's system
 . a union over the states that recursively distinguish one change from counterfactual of that change
 .. a measurable variable `x` must be physical variable `X`
 . then measurement is a task M : union over {x —> psi[x]} for all x in X (with side effect)
. the resulting set {psi[x]} defines the information variable of non-perturbative kind.




(PART 4/3)

communication : where two devices engage in a non-perturbative sequence of exchange of messages
.. a pair of messages (x, y), is said to be distinguishable
. if `x (perpendicularize) y`, then `y` is distinguishable from `x`
 . if `y` is distinguishable from `x`, then `x` is also distingishable variable.
 .. `x` and `y` paired as distinguishable variable
. `(x, y)` constitute a system of distinguishable attributes in a reversible information processing medium.



(PART 4/4)

non-perturbative measurement : if the pair of attributes `{x, x}` ≈ `{ș, ș}` in the original substrate continue to exist
.. (~3~) can store the outcome `{psi[ș]}` where `ș` is sharp and `ș * ş = Ș` with `Ș ≈ X` being a physical variable
. when `Ş` is prepared with the blank state in presence of `ş` for some attribute `ș` constituting the attribute of the original substrate
 . union over {(ș, ş) —> (ś[ș], š[message])} for all ș in Ś where `message` will decode to represent the abstract outcome of `ș`
 .. `ś : * | ș —> *` where `*` is the index prepared with blank state for `ś` going through transformation to land at `ś[*]`'s associated attribute
 . `š : ś | ș —> ś[*]` where `š` only indicates a counter from direct injection of anything into its neighboring slot as the definite property of the expected outcome
. the process is analogous to cloning action, expect the participating variable constitute an information medium instead of a second instance of the substrate that is cloned.
