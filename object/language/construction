! constructor @ 1--0 & 0++1 ! possible


note the last line directive:
. it starts with ! assertion
.. it implies that (..) was possible
. however the line ends with only the assertion again without including any directive (!) at that attribute.

. also note that all assertions and dichotomies before followed the exclusive denotation to the universal constructor of the transformation context
.. then a denotation that does not completely specify every intermediate reactants and reagents as well as those that copy constructor can denote while supplying them with their applied description
. constructor shall not participate in the next cycle unless all of the denotation include its own description as well.
which the stated attribute is equal to the associated attribute at the beginning.
