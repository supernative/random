stereo / mono - mid / side - left / right:
. mid may not be contained in the stereo image
. squeezing mid expands the image
. expanding side squeezed the center
. mid + side -> left and mid - side -> right

theory: the mid-side defines what the stereo image could be interpreted from.
. for all positions on the stereo field, there is a constant mass which is conserved during conversion.
. (source)(code) programmer writes at the highest of level
. (compilation) preprocessed to handle directives
 . (preprocess) (#include, #define)
  . (compilation) preprocessed source compiled into (assembly)(language)
 . (assembly) compiler sqruits out the substrate dependent code
. (assembler) convertion of machine to binary
(object) binary executable
~ (linker) connects multiple object code together and manages reference issues between modules and linking libraries.
(executable) ~ computer program!

[runtime] : loader
.. operating system loads executable binaries to working memory.
[runtime] : pi
.. initialize state (as definition @ start) -> loader
.. program counter (as set @ entry) -> exec

[execution] : serial or parallel
.. (serial) machine code executed sequentially @ instructed
 .. modify registers
 . memory
. counter

.. machine state : register/memory/counter
. dynamical(~execution) is possible!

[assembly] : state
.. boot(strap)
. program(~) is possible!

[program] : bootstrap @ loader
.. while in firmware (init system & loads)
. operating system (~other) is possible!

[init] : hardware[0]
.. state (loads main program) -> memory
. jump (~entry) point possible!

[assembler] : state
.. source (code)
. level (~assembly) is possible!

.. compilation (source)
. machine (~compiled) is possible with side-effects!!

.. execution (runtime)
. assembly (target) -> language program -> machine code

[assembly] : state
.. execution (while ran) -> substrate
. (~) possible | pi(~) for (register, memory)
<- (in assembly, in machine) .. . translates!!

[runtime] : interaction
.. assembler (is possible)
. new (~snippet) is possible with side-effect!!
