stereo / mono - mid / side - left / right:
. mid may not be contained in the stereo image
. squeezing mid expands the image
. expanding side squeezed the center
. mid + side -> left and mid - side -> right

theory: the mid-side defines what the stereo image could be interpreted from.
. for all positions on the stereo field, there is a constant mass which is conserved during conversion.
