heading task ... discussions about conflicts

.. some direct comparison to possible conflict free situations

..

if I can remember plenty scattered information like such, a computer program should be able to do this too.
it should have many more ways of doing the best version of it.

it doesn't have to be intelligent at all, so we could implement many possible algorithms.

let this be a pure optimization game!

here is how I would have done it:
. search and search and more search
. tangent from search and search from tangent even more
. possibly arrive but change or expand the search even more

aside from the search stuff, there are a lots of navigating and aimless path traveling scope.
which i would be fine without.

whatever cannot be remotely automated via internet, it should learn to extract those via chatgpt, gemini etc.
it should get my access to those as direct means away completely.

Interpreter: ...

random memory : access to them?

tell me briefly in procedural form how random access memory is utilized.
i want to know these:
- why are they better than deterministic access
- how come random access be faster than any other way
- given that these are the fastest access protocols and the memory is exclusively referred to as those kinds of access, draw the picture for me as to what magic it holds
- abstracting away from hardware level description, consider a simple python program and the random module -- now outline the process (actual) at that level of abstraction
